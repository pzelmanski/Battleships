            1x Battleship (5 squares)
            2x Destroyers (4 squares)
        The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”,
        where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, 
        to specify a square to target. 
        Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. 
        The game ends when all ships are sunk.
